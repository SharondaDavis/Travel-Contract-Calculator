# Travel Nurse AI Assistant

A privacy-focused, client-side application for travel nurses to analyze and compare contract offers. Built with modern web standards and designed to be interoperable with healthcare systems through SMART FHIR standards, this tool puts nurses in control of their contract data while maintaining complete privacy.

## Privacy & Security

- **100% Client-Side Operation**: All data is stored locally in your browser using Dexie.js (a wrapper for IndexedDB)
- **No Server Storage**: Your contract details never leave your device
- **Complete Data Ownership**: You maintain full control over your contract information
- **Local Processing**: All calculations and AI analysis happen on your device
- **Secure API Integration**: OpenAI API calls are made directly from your browser with your API key

## Standards & Interoperability

This application follows SMART FHIR standards to demonstrate how nurses can build interoperable applications that work seamlessly across healthcare systems. While this specific tool focuses on contract analysis, it serves as an example of how to:

- Implement standards-based data layers using FHIR API and resource definitions
- Build applications that can be integrated into various healthcare systems
- Create tools that follow healthcare interoperability standards
- Develop applications that maintain data privacy while being interoperable

The goal is to empower nurses to build applications that:
- Can run anywhere in the healthcare system
- Follow established healthcare standards
- Maintain data privacy and security
- Are easily integrated with other healthcare tools
